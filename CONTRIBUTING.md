We adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for this project. All contributors are expected to follow this code of conduct. Please review it before getting involved.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute to our project. Whether you are a security researcher, developer, or enthusiast, your input is valuable to us. Here's how you can contribute:

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or potential threats within the project codebase, **do not** create a public issue. Instead, please email us directly at [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com). We value responsible disclosure and will work with you to address the issue promptly and securely.

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Found a bug or have a great idea for a new feature? We welcome bug reports and feature requests through GitHub Issues. Before submitting, search existing issues to avoid duplicates. When submitting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the problem.

### Pull Requests

We are happy to accept Pull Requests (PRs) from the community. Here's how you can contribute code to the project:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes, ensuring to follow our [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines).
3. Test your changes thoroughly.
4. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)).
5. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch.

Our maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback if necessary. Please be patient as the review process may take some time. Once approved, we'll merge your changes and credit you for your contribution.

## Coding Guidelines

To ensure code consistency and maintainability, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or functions.
- Follow best practices for writing secure code, especially in cybersecurity-related code.
- Write unit tests to cover your code and ensure its reliability.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information or credentials.

## Commit Messages

A well-structured commit message helps us understand the changes made in your PR. Please format your commit messages using the following guidelines:

- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature").
- Start with a brief summary (around 50 characters or less) describing the change.
- Optionally, provide a more detailed description of the changes in the body of the message.
- Reference relevant issues or pull requests if applicable (e.g., "Fixes #123").
