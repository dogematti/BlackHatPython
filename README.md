Please do not try this at home. Gatherings of malware/ransomware etc. Written in Python together with the help of A.I.

##To install make flood.py work, you need to first:
1:' chmod +x flood-setup.sh && sudo bash flood-setup.sh ', then run python3 flood.py --help without proxychains or use it with proxychains with flood-setup.sh's declared name "proxy_flood" or "proxy_flood --help" Works in every directory :). Check the code. Theres nothing malicious its just a stresstest tool I made with some questions from A.I.
